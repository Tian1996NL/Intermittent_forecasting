# Intermittent_forecasting
Using different methods in forecasting spare parts demand, in total 12 methods ( Croston, Croston optimized, TSB, SBA, Willemain, RNN, LSTM, ESRNN, and 4 combined methods) on 4 simulated and 4 industrial data sets. 

The code for the Willemain method and the framework for price generation is based on De Haan (2021), while the code for data cleaning and inventory performance is adapted from Nguyen (2023).
